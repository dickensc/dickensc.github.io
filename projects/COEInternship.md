During the summer of 2017 I was a mentor for a group of High School students participating in UH Manoa's 
College of Engineering Internship Program. I was a representative of the Electrical Engineering department's
Big Data lab. 

I introduced the students to some of the fundamentals of graph theory, probability and statistics, the python 
language, object orientied programming, and more. The introduction to all this material was wrapped inside 
the final project that I planned from the beginning. 

At the end of the 6 weeks the students presented the project to peers in other labs, Manoa faculty, and the 
program's sponsors.
