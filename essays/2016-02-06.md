##### Why I Want to Learn Software Engineering #####

On the first day of class for my course on Software Engineering my professor had us work through a brief but important exercise. He asked us to take out a piece of paper and then directed, "take 30 seconds to write down what your passion is. go." 

Only allowing that short amount of time I think forces you to write down the truth. I put the first thing that came to mind.

"Now trade papers with the person sitting next to you. Read what your neighbors passion is and take 30 seconds to write down how software engineering, or computer science in general will help your neighbor pursue their passion." 

I complied and took my 30 seconds. What he said next humored me but also made me think.

"Okay now pass your papers back. If your neighbor left you with a blank paper, they couldn't think of any way that this class or computer science could help you pursue your passion, you should drop this class."
