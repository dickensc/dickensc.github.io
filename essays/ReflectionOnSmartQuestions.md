It turns out, contrary to what Mrs. McGillicuddy promised me in grade school, that there are such things as Stupid Questions! (Well at least stupid ways to ask them.) 

Eric Steven Raymond provides a guide to communicating with hackers, like himself, in his essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way". Raymond clarifies what the smarter, smart, and stupid ways to ask questions are. 

He leads with an introduction for the reader, warning of the blunt tone he and the open source community share, not to be interpreted as arrogant, but rather necessary for efficiency. He goes on to explain that the experts that are answering questions are doing us a favor, they are sharing their hard earned wisdom with those in need. These experts are also typically very busy people, and therefore their time and effort should be respected. If you put little to no effort into researching your problem or designing your question before you start asking others for help, then you should not expect a quality answer. 

## How To Ask A Stupid Question ##

Raymond defines ways to properly identify stupid questions. Let us analyze a real life example to gain a better understanding.

I was so delighted to find this question on the popular site Stack Overflow. This question has many of the traits Raymond refers to in his article and we have a lot to learn from it.

Let us begin with the subject header: "Why always syntax error in my code?". Reading this subject header alone tells us... next to nothing, I have no idea what to expect besides messy code. This question is not interesting either, a hacker looking to solve a thought provoking problem would not blink twice at this post before carrying on with their day.

Next we continue to read the full problem description in our example, it states "In this shell code, I have no idea why always say I have a syntax error and I use this function to calculate the medium and average of row number."

Raymond puts it best when he points out, "We've found by experience that people who are careless and sloppy writers are usually also careless and sloppy at thinking and coding (often enough to bet on, anyway)."  

Now this person may be writing the question in English but it is a second language to them, but for this post we are left to assumptions. Raymond suggests that it is a good idea to alert respondents of language barriers and provide options to get around them.
