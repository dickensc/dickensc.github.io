It turns out, contrary to what Mrs. McGillicuddy promised me in grade school, that there are such things as Stupid Questions! (Well at least stupid ways to ask them.) 

Eric Steven Raymond provides a guide to communicating with hackers, like himself, in his essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way". Raymond clarifies what the smarter, smart, and stupid ways to ask questions are. 

He leads with an introduction for the reader, warning of the blunt tone he and the open source community share, not to be interpreted as arrogant, but rather necessary for efficiency. He goes on to explain that the experts that are answering questions are doing us a favor, they are sharing their hard earned wisdom with those in need. These experts are also typically very busy people, and therefore their time and effort should be respected. If you put little to no effort into researching your problem or designing your question before you start asking others for help, then you should not expect a quality answer. 

Raymond defines many ways a question could be stupid by breaking it up into pieces. Let us analyze a real example to gain a better understanding.
