At the moment, I am taking a course on Software Engineering from UH Manoa's Information and Computer Science Department. It is the first week of class and we have already began our 3rd module: Javascript Basics. Appropriately named, the Javascript Basics module is intended help us students become competent with elementary Javascript. The goals are to be able to use basic Javascript constructs such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, objects, implement object orientation using the ES6 class construct and use the Underscore library to program in a functional manner.

This is the first time I am being formally introduced to Javascript. I am currently in my 8th semester as a Computer Engineering student, so I am aware of its ubiquity on the web and am eager to learn. 

My experience is mostly with languages such as C, C++, and Java. As it was explained to me by my professor, Dr. Phillip Johnson, the languages Java, C, and C++ stem primarily from Assembler and interacting with the physical registers and memory in the computer while Javascript "comes from much more abstract notions about computation". So I am expecting Javascript to be a higher level programming language than what I am used to.

So far I have completed the FreeCodeCamp basic JavaScript exercises. This basic JavaScript module includes 106 exercises to introduce the syntax and basics of programming with JavaScript. I also have started reading sections of the ES6 for Humans book available [here](https://github.com/metagrover/ES6-for-humans). I have read the section on let, const and block scoping, as well as for...of vs for...in. 

At this point (I am a total novice with the language), my opinion, of JavaScript is positive. JavaScript seems to be easy to use and powerful.

Some resons JavaScript is looking great are: 
    
    - The syntax is simple and efortless to adopt. 
    
    - Creating functions is less verbose than Java and more flexible than C and declaring and initializing variables intuitive. 
        - The function signature in JavaScript does not need to include the return type or the parameter types, this information is determined automatically by the function's implementation which is very convienent. 
        - When declaring and initializing variables the variable type does not need to be stated, it is inferred by the initialization and usage. 
    
    - The content of an array can vary in type, this is contrary to many other programming languages and is very effective.

However, a small but painless difference compared to my prior programming experience is the convention (not requirement) to primarily use the keywords let and const when declaring and initializing variables. This convention controls the scope and mutabilty of the variable in a way that is easy to understand and may prevent bugs.
