At the moment, I am taking a course on Software Engineering from UH Manoa's Information and Computer Science Department. It is the first week of class and we have already began our 3rd module: Javascript Basics. Appropriately named, the Javascript Basics module is intended help us student become competent with elementary Javascript. The goals are to be able to use basic Javascript constructs such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, arrays, objects, implement object orientation using the ES6 class construct and use the Underscore library to program in a functional manner.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
